# Audio file shuffler

Poor's man music shuffler!

## Installation

0. Download and install Python (if you havent already).
1. Install the dependencies by running `pip install inquirer` and `pip install shutil` (later is probably already installed)
2. Download the `00_randomise.py` file and the `000_randomise.bat` file (optional)
3. Move the files to the folder where you want to shuffle the files
4. Run the script by running the .bat file (or .py if you dont want to use it)

## How does it work?

This script prepends a random string followed by a "~" to allow to recover the original filename.
